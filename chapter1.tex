\section{Context}

Municipal solid waste (MSW) production has been increasing in the last few
years, along with economic growth\citep{McCarthy94}. This has led to the need
--- and subsequent development --- of efficient waste management solutions.
Waste management involves not only the collection, but also the transportation,
recycling and disposal of generated waste.

One can find several case studies reporting the methodologies used by several
countries, as well as reports describing the MSW generation quantities and
patterns.

According to \citet{Bhat1996}, up to 85\% of some cities waste management
budget spent goes to MSW collection and disposal. This information turns route
optimization into an important field of study regarding the optimization of MSW
management processes.

This information caused several cities around the world to study and apply
optimization techniques for waste collection route generation.
